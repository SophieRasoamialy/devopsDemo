  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "index-html" branch
  #push:
   # branches: [ "index-html" ]
   pull_request:
     branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runner's shell
      - name: Display message
        run: echo Hello, world!
